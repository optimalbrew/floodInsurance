"_Floods are the most common and costly natural hazard in the nation._" ([source: fema.gov](https://www.fema.gov/wildfires-you-need-flood-insurance)). 

Low adoption rates of catastrophic insurance for floods or mudslides have been in the news recently. In addition to storm related flooding, there are also increasing concerns about _sunny-day floods_. These are (increasingly frequent) situations where sea water is driven up coastal sewer systems by strong tides (particularly in the absence of storms or hurricanes). 

This project estimates the impact of prices and geographic (long/lat) location on insurance adoption rates. Estimates are obtained using regression and also using a blend of random forest based estimation with linear regression.
